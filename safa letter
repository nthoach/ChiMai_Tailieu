To the 	Khalifa University Postgraduate Admission Committee:
I write this letter to highly recommend Ms. Safa Mohammed Sali to the PhD program in Electrical & Computer Engineering at Khalifa University. I have known Ms. Safe since she joined Khalifa University for her internship in June 2024. I have been working with her on the current research: “Novel SEPIC Converter with Enhanced Voltage Gain and Reduced Voltage Stresses,” as her co-advisor/mentor on research activities along with Dr. Ameena Saad Al-Sumaiti (Associate Professor at KU). She has demonstrated exceptional performance in research and always completes every assignment on time when doing research and laboratory work.
Ms. Safa is a strong candidate for the Ph.D. program in Electrical Engineering & Computer Science because of her academic and communication English skills, science and technology background, BTECH. &MTECH credentials, and excellent working/self-studying skills. She has an IELTS score of 7.5, and in working with her, I find no barrier in English communication in all her speaking, listening, writing, and reading skills. Furthermore, her academic English skills are also exhibited via her recent paper writing as we are co-authors. His GRE score evidences her strong background in science and technology. Furthermore, through my co-supervising on her internship and working on her current research project on power electronics, she has used her excellent skills and background in using Matlab/Simulink platform, DST, and Texas instruments in laboratory and prototype creation, office-related software, mathematics, and self-studying to fulfill each assigned step for her current research topic with me and Dr. Ameena.
Furthermore, Ms. Safa already prepared well for her research-oriented journey in her Ph.D. program not only by background and skills but also by publishing scientific papers at some conferences and by preparing high-quality manuscripts for to-ranked journals in her specific research area.
To sum up, Ms. Safa is an outstanding candidate for the Ph.D. program in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Khalifa University. Therefore, I highly recommend her and believe that her outstanding performance and qualifications will help her to excel as a Ph. D student at Khalifa University and have excellent achievements as an independent researcher soon.
Yours Sincerely,
Nguyen The Hoach

FPGA/embedded-AI researcher with cross-domain experience in power electronics and real-time computer vision for 
autonomous systems. Skilled in PS–PL integration on Xilinx Zynq/Kria, AXI4-Stream pipelines, DMA/interrupts, 
Vitis/Vivado toolchains, and compressed-domain tracking using H.264 motion vectors. Comfortable compiling DNNs 
with Vitis AI, optimizing resource/performance trade-offs (LUT/DSP/BRAM vs FPS/latency), and building 
reproducible benchmarking on edge SoCs. 
CORE TECHNICAL SKILLS 
• Platforms: Xilinx PYNQ-Z2 (Zynq-7000), Kria KV260 (Zynq UltraScale+), Raspberry Pi 
• Toolchains: Vivado (IP Integrator, constraints, clocking), Vitis (drivers, bare-metal/Linux apps), Vitis AI 
(quantizer/optimizer/.xmodel), PYNQ, Docker, Git 
• HDL / HLS / Interfaces: Verilog (reading/customization), HLS basics, AXI4-Stream, AXI4-Lite, AXI DMA 
(MM2S/S2MM), VDMA, PL interrupts to PS (GIC), PS-PL reset/clocking, DDR bandwidth awareness 
• Vision / AI: YOLOv3 and SSD deployment; INT8 quantization flows; model conversion (Darknet/ONNX → 
Vitis AI); pre/post-processing on PL/PS; throughput/latency profiling; basic pruning/tiling awareness 
• Video / Compressed Domain: H.264 bitstream (NAL/SPS/PPS/SLICE), motion-vector use for tracking; 
GStreamer/FFmpeg pipelines; RTSP ingest; zero-copy buffers where applicable

EXPERIENCE 
Visiting Researcher — Khalifa University | Abu Dhabi, UAE | April 2025 – Present 
• Department of Computer & Information Engineering (Embedded AI & FPGA Acceleration) 
• Built PS–PL dataflow on PYNQ-Z2 for foundational IP (LED/Counter/Sobel) to master AXI4-Lite control and 
AXI4-Stream DMA movement; validated interrupt-driven completion on PS via GIC; verified timing (PL fabric 
clock) and basic back-pressure handling. 
• Ported real-time object detection to Kria KV260 using Vitis AI: prepared datasets and preprocessing, 
converted/quantized models (YOLOv3/SSD → INT8), compiled to DPUCZDX8G .xmodel, and integrated 
runtime with video I/O on embedded Linux. 
• Constructed GStreamer capture/parse pipelines and evaluation harnesses; prototyped PS-side C++ and Python 
bindings. 
• Benchmarked throughput, pipeline latency, and CPU/PL utilization under varied input sizes; documented resource 
impacts (LUT/DSP/BRAM) of moving pre/post-proc kernels to PL (resize, color-space, Sobel). 
• Wrote reproducible scripts (Dockerized Vitis AI flows) to rebuild overlays and re-run tests; captured board bring
up steps, device-tree notes, and DPU runner configs for repeatability. 
• Current project: Implement a compressed-domain tracking pipeline that extracts/uses H.264 motion vectors to 
trigger on-demand tracking/detection rather than continuous dense flow—reducing compute and improving 
FPS/W.
